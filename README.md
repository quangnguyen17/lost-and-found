# Lost&Found
Powered by DojoAfterDark

"A missing item finder app that will help users find their glasses, keys, wallet, socks and other items that they put somewhere and then forget where they actually placed them. One way to do this is taking a pic with your phone each time you place such an item so that you can look at the pic if you forget about it later."
